# backend
This is the backend for the diary app. This app allows users to create a login and enter diary entries that will be preserved across days and logins. The application allows for one entry every day and contains a rating system that can be visualized on a statistics page. It allows for anyone looking to keep track of their days to do so easily and reflect on days and months as a whole.
